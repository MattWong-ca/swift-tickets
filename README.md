# ðŸ¤– "It's Me, Hi, I'm The Problem, It's Me"
You've likely heard of Ticketmasterâ€™s inability to handle bots, especially in November '22 when fans waited HOURS (just to get nothing), or most recently in August '23, with their Eras Tour Verified Fan program basically being a lottery ticketâ€”thousands of fans were waitlisted.

It's a huge opportunity. According to Statista:
> _"Revenue in the Event Tickets market is projected to reach $78B USD in 2023, [...] and an expected 760M users by 2027"_

Ticketmaster is a monopoly and their Verified Fan just doesn't work.
